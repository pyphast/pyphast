# Introducing pyphast
<p>Hi, my name is Kevin. <br>
  I am a self-taught software developer. Currently I am focusing on learning the python programming language.

## My programming story
I was always interested in building something with my own hands. Practical crafting was never really my strength (mostly helping my dad with stuff). 
I had a nick in IT builds though. And so, I was building my own computers in my early teen years. However, I was never focusing on actually building something with software at that time.
In our school IT classes we only learned the use of BlueJ, so basically coding was never really happening in my school years.

My first “real” contact with programming was in my information and electronic engineering studies. The focus was on digital programming and C++. 
I never got the hang of it. I felt like a failure not being able to understand software languages and dropped it.

A few years later, I was reintroduced into programming with C# during my apprenticeship. I was finally able to get a grasp of software development and aced the classes. 
Then I started a job with a focus in system integration. I was responsible for our systems and knew every nook and cranny. 
Yet, I was never the person who actually built the stuff, but only giving agencies the order what to build for our business. 

Over the years, I always have this demon in the back of my head, telling me that I am not able to build something from scratch using software. 
Now, I am in a position where I want to tackle this demon by doing a reorientation and learn new skills in software development.</p>
